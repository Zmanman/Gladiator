## Video
<!--- Video: Use a level two header to at the very top, and embed the video of your project. In order to embed
the video, find your YouTube video ID, and insert the following in final.md after the header:
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
As in the status report, the video should contain a brief problem description (using images, screenshots,
or screen captures), an example capture of how a simple baseline performs, and an example capture of
a run that is your best. You are free to include more details, such as summary of how you did it, some of
the failure cases, but it is not needed. The video should be a maximum of three minutes (less is fine), of
reasonably high quality, i.e. a minimum resolution of 1200 × 720 (i.e. 720p), and speech, if any, should be
comprehensible. --->



## Project Summary
<!--- Project Summary: Use another level-two header to start a Project Summary section. Write a few paragraphs
summarizing the goals of the project (yes, yet again, but updated/improved version from the status). In
particular, make sure that the problem is clearly defined here, and feel free to use an image or so to set up
the task. Part of the evaluation will be on how well you are able to motivate the challenges of the problem,
i.e. why is it not trivial, and why you need AI/ML algorithms to solve it. --->



## Approaches
<!--- Approaches: Use another level-two header called Approaches, In this section, describe both the baselines
and your proposed approach(es). Describe precisely what the advantages and disadvantages of each are,
for example, why one might be more accurate, need less data, take more time, overfit, and so on. Include
enough technical information to be able to (mostly) reproduce your project, in particular, use pseudocode
and equations as much as possible. --->



## Evaluation
<!--- Evaluation: An important aspect of your project, as I’ve mentioned several times now, is evaluating your
project. Be clear and precise about describing the evaluation setup, for both quantitative and qualitative
results. Present the results to convince the reader that you have solved the problem, to whatever extent you
claim you have. Use plots, charts, tables, screenshots, figures, etc. as needed. I expect you will need at least
a few paragraphs to describe each type of evaluation that you perform. --->

<!--- References: Make a list of work you’re citing in your description above (starting with a level-two header).
This should include any papers you think are relevant, third-party source code you used, sources for any of
the images that you didn’t create, and any other websites/links you found useful. --->



## References
